                    <p>I’m a user experience professional that loves to improve usability and accessibility with data-driven designs. I used to build stuff to help smart people (scientists) effectively communicate their research, but now I mostly focus on UX strategy including: product strategy, defining value in UX for an organization, and validated user research. Other fun stuff I enjoy at a department level: establishing baseline metrics, appropriate KPIs, and implementing staff competency matrices and evaluation rubrics.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I currently work as a senior UX designer for Dragos, an industrial cybersecurity startup. Previously I was at RS21, a bootstrapped startup focused on resiliency solutions and Descartes Labs, the highest funded startup in New Mexico history. Before that, I worked for the government as a contractor for many years (Sandia National Labs, DOD NRO). I graduated from Iowa State with a Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction in December 2017.</p>
